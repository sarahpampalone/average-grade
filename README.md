# average-grade

/* The program starts by creating 3 objects of the class Assignment, which contains variables grade and name.
Using a series of print statements and inputs, the user is then directed through the process of defining these variables.
When the grade inputed, the ParseInt function is used to convert the data from string to integer.
The three grades are then summed and averaged, and this average is printed. */
